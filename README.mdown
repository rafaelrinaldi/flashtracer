# flashtracer

Script written in Shell Script that makes easier to manage all the logs generated by Flash.
The first version was made by [Arthur Debert][arthur_debert] and I just changed a few things and added some functionalities.

To start the script, just open the Terminal and write: "sh flashtracer"
